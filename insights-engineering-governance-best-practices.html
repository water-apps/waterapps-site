                A practical baseline for teams that want faster delivery and fewer regressions: PR-first workflow, GitOps approvals, story points, CI/CD guardrails, and explicit security ownership.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Mistake Most Teams Make</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Teams often treat governance and delivery speed as opposites. When incidents happen, they add manual approvals and extra checks. When delivery slows down, they bypass process. Both reactions increase risk.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The better pattern is to define <strong>lightweight but enforced rules</strong> for how changes move through the system, then automate everything around those rules. Good governance removes ambiguity and rework, which usually improves speed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">
                Examples are generalized from enterprise and regulated delivery environments to respect confidentiality obligations.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. PR-First Delivery</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        No direct push to <code>main</code> for normal changes. Every change is reviewed in a PR with CI checks, so risk is assessed before merge instead of after deployment.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. GitOps Apply Rules by Blast Radius</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Independent app repos can use controlled auto-apply on <code>main</code>. Shared infrastructure repos (IAM, bootstrap, platform) should use manual approved apply only. Treat dependency depth as a deployment policy input.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Branch Protection Is Part of Runtime Safety</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        For config repos, Git is effectively the apply button. That means branch protection is not “repo hygiene”; it is an operational safety control. Required checks, linear history, and no force-pushes preserve rollback confidence and auditability.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. CODEOWNERS for Security-Sensitive Paths</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Enforce code-owner reviews on <code>.github/workflows/</code> and <code>terraform/</code> paths. This prevents workflow and infra changes from being treated like ordinary docs edits.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Story Points Before Execution</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Estimate work before implementation starts. Story points are not for precision; they expose oversized work early, improve sequencing, and make it easier to split risky changes before they become delivery blockers.
                    </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Use a small default scale and optimize for conversations, not reporting theater:
            </p>
            <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>1</strong>: tiny fix / low risk</div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>2</strong>: small scoped change</div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>3</strong>: medium change, single repo</div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>5</strong>: larger change, workflow/config impact</div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>8</strong>: cross-file / cross-system complexity</div>
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-100 p-4"><strong>13</strong>: too large, split before starting</div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-5">
                The key governance behavior is simple: if a change estimates at <strong>13</strong>, split it before implementation. That reduces merge risk, rework, and review fatigue.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Lessons from Real CI/CD and OIDC Drift Incidents</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                One recurring failure pattern is treating repo renames or new repos as purely organizational changes. In OIDC-based CI/CD, repo names are part of the trust policy. Rename the repo and your plan/apply pipeline can fail immediately.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Best practice: treat repo rename/addition as an IAM/OIDC change event. Update trust allowlists, run a preflight check that prints expected trusted subjects, and fail early with a clear message when trust does not match.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Capturing these incidents as RCA issues and closing them with explicit remediation notes is not bureaucracy. It is how teams stop rediscovering the same failure modes.

                <li>Review failed and skipped CI runs</li>
                <li>Review secret scanning and Dependabot alerts</li>
                <li>Review branch protection drift on key repos</li>
                <li>Review open infra/security issues and blockers</li>
                <li>Close completed items with retrospective notes (if they fixed regressions or risk gaps)</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                This cadence is small enough to sustain and strong enough to prevent silent drift.
