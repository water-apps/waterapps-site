# WaterApps Website Legal Do and Don'ts

Practical publishing guardrails for `waterapps-site`.

This is a working checklist to reduce legal/compliance risk in public website content. It is not legal advice.

## Purpose

Use this before publishing:

- homepage copy changes
- case studies
- testimonials / endorsements
- new pages (services, advisory, insights)
- lead capture / analytics changes

## Legal Do's

### Claims and metrics

- Do use only claims you can substantiate (resume, contract deliverables, public profile, or documented evidence).
- Do keep an internal record of where each metric came from.
- Do qualify outcomes when context matters (for example, "project-specific outcome", "in that environment").
- Do use anonymized case studies by default for public pages.

### Client references and confidentiality

- Do generalize client names to sector labels unless naming is clearly safe and intentional.
- Do state that some project details are generalized for confidentiality obligations.
- Do remove or soften identifying implementation details if they could expose confidential architecture.

### Testimonials and endorsements

- Do use LinkedIn recommendations as proof signals with careful attribution.
- Do keep wording accurate to the original meaning.
- Do add a short disclaimer that recommendations reflect individual experiences.
- Do keep a screenshot/link record for any public testimonial used.

### Privacy and data collection

- Do update `privacy.html` when you add or change analytics, forms, cookies, or third-party embeds.
- Do clearly disclose third-party services (for example, Calendly, Google Analytics).
- Do add user-visible notices when booking/contact flows involve third-party processing.

### Marketing communications

- Do treat enquiry responses differently from marketing campaigns.
- Do obtain appropriate consent before adding contacts to marketing lists.
- Do include sender identity and unsubscribe options in marketing emails.

### Site hygiene and external links

- Do add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links using `target="_blank"`.
- Do review third-party scripts periodically (Calendly, analytics, CDN dependencies).
- Do keep wording precise when describing compliance experience (e.g. "worked under APRA-aligned controls" vs implying certification).

## Legal Don'ts

### Claims and outcomes

- Don't publish unverified numbers, percentages, or performance claims.
- Don't imply guaranteed outcomes ("we will reduce costs by X%") unless contractually supported and qualified.
- Don't present estimated or placeholder metrics as historical facts.

### Client naming and endorsements

- Don't imply client endorsement just because a client name is mentioned.
- Don't use client logos or formal names without permission if risk tolerance is low.
- Don't quote testimonials from memory; use exact source-backed wording or paraphrase carefully.

### Compliance and security wording

- Don't claim certifications, accreditations, or clearances you do not currently hold.
- Don't overstate compliance ("fully compliant") if you mean experience working within compliance frameworks.
- Don't reveal sensitive architecture/security controls that could breach confidentiality obligations.

### Privacy and marketing

- Don't add new tracking scripts or forms without updating privacy disclosures.
- Don't assume Calendly/analytics disclosures are covered by their own pages alone; disclose your use too.
- Don't send marketing follow-ups without a compliant unsubscribe path.

## Safer Wording Patterns (Examples)

Use these patterns when drafting public content:

- `Experience delivering in regulated environments across banking, government, and telecommunications`
- `Worked under APRA- and PCI DSS-aligned controls`
- `Selected case studies are generalized to respect confidentiality obligations`
- `Recommendations available via LinkedIn profile`
- `Outcomes shown are project-specific and depend on scope, constraints, and baseline conditions`

Avoid these patterns:

- `Guaranteed compliance`
- `Endorsed by [client]` (unless explicitly true and permitted)
- `100% secure`
- `Fully compliant with [framework]` (unless formally assessed and accurate in context)

## Pre-Publish Checklist (Fast Pass)

Before pushing website content:

1. Are all metrics source-backed?
2. Are client names/logos intentionally approved or generalized?
3. Are testimonials accurately attributed and disclaimer present?
4. Does the content avoid implied endorsement?
5. Does `privacy.html` still match current tracking/contact flows?
6. Are new external links hardened with `noopener noreferrer`?
7. Is wording precise for compliance/security claims?

## Escalate for Legal Review (When to Stop and Ask)

Get legal review before publishing if any of the following apply:

- You want to add client logos or explicit client endorsements
- You plan to name sensitive projects with detailed architecture
- You are adding a lead magnet form or newsletter capture workflow
- You are changing privacy practices materially (cookies, retargeting, CRM sync)
- You are publishing strong contractual/compliance claims

## Suggested Process (Ongoing)

- Draft content
- Run this checklist
- Record evidence for claims
- Publish
- Review quarterly (or after major site changes)
