# US Market Positioning (WaterApps)

Purpose: Provide a practical positioning layer for US-targeted outreach and website messaging, while keeping current AU-regulated proof as the primary evidence base.

## Positioning Principle

Use this structure:

- **Recent proof** = Australian regulated delivery (banking, government, telecommunications)
- **Career breadth** = enterprise experience across Australia, US, and UK

This avoids overstating recency of US/UK client work while still leveraging global credibility.

## Core Message (US-Friendly)

WaterApps helps enterprise teams modernize platform delivery, CI/CD, and cloud operations in control-heavy environments, with a focus on auditability, reliability, and practical execution.

## What Makes the US Positioning Credible

- 20+ years enterprise delivery experience
- Recent regulated-sector platform/DevSecOps work (AU banking/government/telco)
- Earlier US/UK enterprise experience (including financial services and retail)
- Hands-on architecture + implementation capability (not strategy-only consulting)

## How to Reference US/UK Experience (Safe Wording)

### Recommended

- `Career experience spans Australian, US, and UK enterprise environments, including financial services and retail organizations.`
- `Earlier enterprise delivery roles included organizations such as Fiserv, CSC, and Tesco, complementing recent regulated-sector platform work in Australia.`
- `Global enterprise delivery experience across AU, US, and UK markets.`

### Avoid

- Wording that implies US client work is recent if it is pre-2015
- Positioning old engagements as current market proof without context
- Over-indexing on brand names without explaining relevance to current capabilities

## US Market Translation Layer (Messaging)

### AU -> US framing examples

- `APRA-aligned controls` -> `audit- and control-heavy environments (e.g. SOC 2 / PCI DSS / internal governance frameworks)`
- `government panel / AusTender` -> `procurement-ready documentation and enterprise evaluation support`
- `regulated industries in Australia` -> `regulated and compliance-sensitive enterprise environments`

## Compliance Wording Guidance (US)

Use:

- `experience working under...`
- `designed for control-heavy environments`
- `supports audit-ready delivery`
- `aligned to common control objectives`

Avoid:

- `certified compliant` (unless accurate and formally assessed)
- `ensures compliance` (too absolute)
- `FedRAMP-ready` (unless specifically true and supportable)

## Website Update Recommendations (Incremental)

### Phase 1 (small edits)

- Founder bio line mentioning AU/US/UK enterprise experience
- Optional “Global enterprise experience” line in credentials or advisory page

### Phase 2 (targeted page)

- Add `US / Global Engagement` section or page covering:
  - remote engagement model
  - time-zone overlap options
  - procurement/evaluation process
  - control-heavy delivery experience

### Phase 3 (content)

- Publish US-terminology blog posts / LinkedIn posts:
  - audit-ready CI/CD (SOC 2 / PCI-aware framing)
  - platform engineering for compliance-sensitive orgs
  - Terraform vs Bicep for Azure enterprise teams

## Sales / Outreach Use Cases

Use this positioning in:

- LinkedIn posts targeting US audiences
- Intro messages and referral requests
- Capability statement variants
- Discovery call positioning for international prospects

## Proof Hierarchy for US Leads

1. Recent AU regulated outcomes (current, detailed, credible)
2. Global career breadth (AU/US/UK)
3. Technical portfolio proof (repos, case-study depth, CI quality, governance plans)
4. Procurement readiness (capability statement, enterprise readiness page)

## Optional Future Feature

If US demand grows:

- create `us-market.html` or `global-engagements.html` in `waterapps-site`
- localize terminology and examples for US buyers while keeping claims evidence-backed
