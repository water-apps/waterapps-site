Cadence:

- 2 posts/week (8 posts total)
- 1 authority/technical post
- 1 buyer/procurement/conversion-oriented post

Recommended posting windows (Sydney time):

- Tue 8:00-9:00 AM

## Week 1

### Post 1 (Tue): Audit-Ready CI/CD

Audience: CTO / Platform leads / Architects

Draft:

```
Most teams in regulated environments try to speed up CI/CD by removing gates.

That usually creates a different problem:
you get faster deploys, but weaker traceability, more manual evidence work, and higher audit friction later.

The better approach is to redesign the delivery path so controls are built into the workflow:

- automated evidence capture
- repeatable environment promotion
- security checks in the normal pipeline
- clear release ownership and traceability

In other words: reduce manual control overhead, not control quality.

That’s the difference between "faster pipelines" and actually improving delivery in banking/government environments.

If you’re assessing this right now, I’ve put together a procurement-friendly capability summary and enterprise readiness page:

```

### Post 2 (Thu): Procurement-Friendly Path

Audience: Procurement / CTO / Delivery managers

Draft:

```
A lot of technical consulting websites make one assumption:
everyone is ready to book a discovery call immediately.

That’s not how enterprise buying works.

Often the first step is:
- capability review
- risk/procurement screening
- checking if the supplier can operate in regulated environments

So we added two low-friction paths before a call:

1) Capability Statement
2) Enterprise Readiness (procurement/risk summary)

This makes it easier for teams to evaluate fit before spending calendar time.

## Week 2

### Post 3 (Tue): Platform Engineering in Regulated Environments

Audience: Architects / Platform leads

Draft:

```
Platform engineering in regulated environments is not just about self-service.

It’s about reducing variance.

The biggest delivery improvements usually come from:

- standardizing release paths
- making controls repeatable
- improving observability and handover quality
- removing hidden tribal knowledge from deployments

Teams don’t just ship faster.
They ship more consistently, with fewer surprises.

That consistency is what unlocks scale in banking and government delivery programs.

We’ve been reflecting that in how we structure case studies publicly (executive summary + expandable technical depth):

```

### Post 4 (Thu): Discovery vs Assessment vs Advisory

Audience: CTO / Heads of Platform / Buyers

Draft:

```
One reason consulting engagements fail early:
the buyer and the consultant are solving different problems.

To reduce that mismatch, we now separate the entry paths:

- Discovery Call (fit + scope direction)
- Architecture Assessment (structured findings + roadmap)
- Advisory / Delivery Support (ongoing principal-led execution)

This sounds simple, but it dramatically improves scoping quality and reduces "wrong first project" starts.

## Week 3

### Post 5 (Tue): Day 2 Operations > Provisioning

Audience: CTO / SRE / Platform leads

Draft:

```
Provisioning is visible, so it gets attention.
Day 2 operations is where the money is made (or lost).

Most modernization work is judged later on:
- alert quality
- incident response speed
- runbook usefulness
- observability coverage
- operational drift control

If your platform program only proves provisioning, buyers are right to ask what happens after go-live.

That’s why we’re expanding our public portfolio to show more operations/observability patterns, not just IaC.

What Day 2 gap is hurting your teams most right now: alert noise, handoffs, or release recovery?
```

### Post 6 (Thu): Compliance-as-Code Framing

Audience: Architects / Security / Platform leads

Draft:

```
Compliance-as-code is often pitched like an audit tool.

In practice, the best use is delivery acceleration.

Why?
Because good policy guardrails reduce review loops and stop avoidable rework early:

- tagging requirements
- image / runtime constraints
- baseline security defaults
- environment consistency checks

Done well, policy-as-code improves both engineering flow and audit readiness.

The key is mapping policy intent to control objectives without pretending "policy = compliance".
```

## Week 4

### Post 7 (Tue): AKS / Azure Architecture Positioning

Audience: Azure-heavy architects / gov/bank teams

Draft:

```
In Azure-heavy enterprises, the IaC discussion is no longer just "Terraform or not?"

It’s often:
Terraform vs Bicep vs mixed model.

A practical rule of thumb:
- Terraform when you need cross-cloud consistency / shared patterns
- Bicep when Azure-native workflows and ARM integration matter more
- Mixed model when platform and app teams have different needs

The wrong decision is treating this as ideology instead of architecture trade-offs.

We’re planning to publish more Azure-native examples (including Bicep paths) because this matters a lot in the AU market.
```

### Post 8 (Thu): What Enterprise Buyers Actually Need

Audience: Procurement / CTO / Program leads

Draft:

```
A lot of consultancy websites optimize for "looking impressive."

Enterprise buyers usually need something simpler first:

- proof of relevant delivery experience
- clear engagement options
- procurement-ready information
- realistic claims (not inflated marketing)
- an easy path to evaluate fit without committing to a call

That’s the standard we’re building toward at WaterApps.
