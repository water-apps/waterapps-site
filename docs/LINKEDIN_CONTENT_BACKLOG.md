## Content Pillars

1. Audit-ready delivery (DevSecOps + governance)
2. Platform engineering and modernization sequencing
3. Day 2 operations / observability / reliability
4. Cloud architecture trade-offs (Terraform, Bicep, AKS/EKS, etc.)
5. Procurement-ready consulting (capability statement, enterprise readiness)

## CTA Destinations (Website)

## Post Ideas Backlog (Ranked)

### Priority A (publish first)

1. Audit-ready CI/CD: why most teams optimize the wrong bottleneck
2. Platform engineering in regulated environments: reduce variance before chasing speed
3. What procurement needs from a technical consultancy (before a call)
4. Day 2 operations is where platform ROI is won (not provisioning)
5. AKS platform lesson: consistency and controls beat heroics
6. How to scope platform modernization without a 6-month “assessment”

### Priority B

7. Terraform vs Bicep for enterprise Azure: decision framework
8. Compliance-as-code as delivery acceleration, not audit theatre
9. Why release gates fail when evidence is manual
10. Architecture advisory vs implementation support: when to use each
11. What “enterprise-ready” actually means for DevSecOps partners
12. FinOps in platform programs: savings come from design discipline, not dashboards alone

### Priority C (repo-led proof posts)

13. What we added to our site CI quality pipeline (and why simple checks matter)
14. Why we added privacy/terms and trust disclaimers before scaling outbound
15. How we structure case studies for both executives and engineers (expandable technical depth)
16. Building procurement-safe capability statement flows without killing conversion

## Post Format Templates

### Template A: Executive/CTO

- Hook: business + risk tension
- Problem pattern (what goes wrong in enterprises)
- Practical insight (1-3 points)
- What to do next (small framework)
- CTA: capability statement / discovery

### Template B: Architect/Engineer

- Hook: architecture or delivery anti-pattern
- Technical detail (tooling/pattern/trade-off)
- Constraint handling (governance, approvals, audit)
- Outcome / operational impact
- CTA: case studies / enterprise readiness

### Template C: Procurement/Risk-Friendly

- Hook: evaluation friction
- What documentation is usually needed
- How to assess consultancy readiness quickly
- Link to capability statement + enterprise readiness

## Content Quality Rules (Aligned to legal checklist)

- Use resume-backed facts only
- Default to anonymized client references on public posts unless intentionally approved
- Avoid implying client endorsement
- Avoid absolute claims ("guaranteed", "fully compliant")
- Prefer "worked under", "designed for", "supports"

## Repurposing Workflow

Website page / repo update -> LinkedIn post -> comment follow-up -> future article

Examples:

- `enterprise-readiness.html` -> procurement-readiness post
- `capability-statement.html` -> "buyers not ready to book a call" post
- site CI pipeline -> "quality gates for marketing sites" post
- future governance repo -> compliance-as-code post
